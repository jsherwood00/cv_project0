        <h3>About:</h3>
        <p>Welcome to my project! I found that GPT-4 doesn't have much success with telling the time from an analog clock, 
            but is successful at classifying function types from an image of a digital graph. For each image, the response given by GPT-4 is included next to it. Details and the images can be found
            by navigating with the hyperlinks at the top of this page! Please email me any feedback and I will do my best to incorporate it for future projects.
        <ul>
            <li>All clock images were sourced from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">pexels.com</a>.</p></li>
            <li><p>All graph images were exported from <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">Desmos.</a></p></li>
            <li><p>GPT-4 was used for this project.</p></li>
